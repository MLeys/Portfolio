      Hello! My name is Mike and I an excited to enter the tech industry as a 
      software engineer / full-stack web developer! I have always been drawn to 
      programming starting with customizing controls in CS back in 2000. 
      Driven by that passion I most recently took a leap of faith and completed the 
      SEI bootcamp at General Assembly.
